    "# More Warm-Up Problems: Balls in Urns\n",
    "\n",
    "Around 1700, [Jacob Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli), wrote about drawing colored balls from an urn in his landmark treatise *[Ars Conjectandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Conjectandi)*, and ever since then, explanations of probability have relied on [drawing balls from urns](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=probability%20ball%20urn). (You'd think the urns would be empty by now.) \n",
    "\n",
    "We might as well try a few of these problems.  For example, here are [four related problems](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/69151.html) adapted from mathforum.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An urn contains 23 balls: 8 white, 6 blue, and 9 red.  We select six balls at random (meaning, each possible selection is equally likely) from the urn. What is the probability of each of these possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. all balls are red\n",
    "2. 3 are blue, 2 are white, and 1 is red\n",
    "3. 2 are blue and 4 are red\n",
    "4. exactly 4 balls are white\n",
    "\n",
    "So, an outcome is a set of 6 balls, and the sample space is the set of all possible 6 ball combinations. We'll solve each problem using our `P` function, and also using basic arithmetic; that is, *counting*. There are two aspects of these kinds of problems that make counting tricky:\n",
    "- We have multiple balls of the same color. \n",
    "- An outcome is a set of balls, where order doesn't matter, but it is often easier to count with sequences of balls, where order does matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the first aspect, I'll have 8 different white balls labelled `'W1'` through `'W8'`, rather than having eight balls all labelled `'W'`.  That makes it clear that selecting `'W1'` is different from selecting `'W2'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the second aspect, I will sometimes first count the number of *permutations* of balls, then get the number of *combinations* by dividing the number of permutations by $c!$, where $c$ is the number of balls in a combination. For example, if I want to choose 2 white balls from the 8 available, there are 8 ways to choose a first white ball and 7 ways to choose a second, and therefore 8 &times; 7 = 56 permutations of two white balls. But there are only 56 / 2 = 28 combinations, because `(W1, W2)` is the same combination as `(W2, W1)`.\n",

    "We see there are 27 relevant outcomes, of which 13 are green. So 13/27 really does seem to be the right answer. This picture also gives us a way to think about why the answer is not 1/3. Think of the yellow-plus-green area as a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe, with an overlap. Each stripe is half yellow and half green, so if there were no overlap at all, the probability of green would be 1/2.  When each stripe takes up half the sample space and the overlap is maximal, the probability is 1/3. And in the Problem 3 table, where the overlap is small, the probability is close to 1/2 (but slightly smaller).\n",

First, if you want to convince me, show me a sample space; don't just make philosophical arguments. (Although a philosophical argument can be employed to help you define the right sample space.) Second, while I agree that before she goes to sleep, Beauty's *unconditional* probability for heads should be 1/2, I would say that both before she goes to sleep and when she is awakened, her *conditional* probability of heads *given that she is being interviewed* should be 1/3, as shown by the sample space."

You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat.

So if you like cars more than goats, you should switch. But don't feel bad if you got this one wrong; it turns out that Monty Hall himself, who opened numerous doors while hosting *Let's Make a Deal* for 13 years, didn't know the answer either, as revealed in this letter from Monty to statistician Lawrence Denenberg, when Denenberg asked for permission to use the problem in his textbook:\n",

    "\n",
    "> *A casino offers a game of chance for a single player in which a fair coin is tossed at each stage. The pot starts at 2 dollars and is doubled every time a head appears. The first time a tail appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus the player wins 2 dollars if a tail appears on the first toss, 4 dollars if a head appears on the first toss and a tail on the second, etc. What is the expected value of this game to the player?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the expected value, we see there is a 1/2 chance of a tail on the first toss (yielding a pot of \\$2) and if not that, a 1/2 &times; 1/2 = 1/4 chance of a tail on the second toss (yielding a pot of \\$4), and so on. So in total, the expected value is:\n",

    "The first major response to the paradox is that the casino's resources are limited. Once you break their bank, they can't pay out any more, and thus the expected return is finite. Let's consider the case where the bank has a limit to their resources, and create a probability distribution for the problem. We keep doubling the pot and halving the probability of winning the amount in the pot (half because you get the pot on a tail but not a head), until we reach the limit."

If I had nothing, and I won \\$1000, I would be very happy. But if I already had a million dollars and I won \\$1000, it would be less valuable. How much less valuable? Bernoulli proposed, and [experiments confirm](https://books.google.com/books?id=1oEa-BiARWUC&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205&dq=mr+beard+oil+wildcatter+value+of+money+utility&source=bl&ots=cBDIX-rkTz&sig=GHB8-inorWrU39vA8JYV_sCtqB8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI5fu-p8qlyAIViKWICh0XAAz5#v=onepage&q=mr%20beard%20oil%20wildcatter%20value%20of%20money%20utility&f=false), that *the value of money is roughly logarithmic.* That is, rational bettors don't try to maximize their expected monetary value, they try to maximize their *expected utility*: the amount of \"happiness\" that the money is worth.\n",
    "I'll write the function `util` to describe what a dollar amount is worth to a hypothetical gambler. `util` says that a dollar is worth a dollar, until the amount is \"enough\" money. After that point, each additional dollar is worth half as much (only brings half as much happiness). Value keeps accumulating at this rate until we reach the next threshold of \"enough,\" when the utility of additional dollars is halfed again. The exact details of `util` are not critical; what matters is that overall money becomes less valuable after we have won a lot of it."
